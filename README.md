ANARI Experiments
=================

This repo is meant as a playground for me to learn ANARI. I'm working off the SDK implementation that can
be found at https://github.com/KhronosGroup/ANARI-SDK

Currently tested with the `example_device` coming with the SDK (`export ANARI_LIBRARY=example`)
but should eventually also work with "real" implemenation.

Uses a couple of dependencies from my personal software ecosystem, mostly to get windowing,
TF editors, mouse interaction etc. working.
